			<dd class="invisi">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values.</dd>

			<dt>My ass is on fire, what should I do?</dt>
			<dd class="invisi">Swimming is not recommended, and is occasionally prohibited, because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer. Soaking in thermal features is illegal. The area known as the Boiling River, north of Mammoth Hot Springs, allows soaking in the Gardner River near thermal outflow, but not in the feature itself. Soaking is allowed during daylight hours only and at your own risk.</dd><p></p>

			<dd class="invisi">Eagle Peak in the southeastern part of Yellowstone is the highest at 11,358 feet.</dd><p></p>
			<dt>I have a body to dump, but it's February. Can I still dump it?</dt>
			<dd class="invisi">Yes, though not all roads are open to cars. You can drive into the park through the North Entrance year-round. The winter season of services, tours, activities, and ranger programs typically spans from mid-December to mid-March.</dd><p></p>
